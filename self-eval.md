# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
first 2 days were really exciting and felt more confident taking on the challenges. The third day (Thursday) with methods and OOP, whew, that just made me feel so defeated. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
first 2 days was pretty good, had some solid breaks and end times (especially being on east coast, it gets late for me working til 8p MT/10p EST). But Thursday - whew. I didn't take any breaks and worked til 9:30p/11:30p. I can stay hyperfocused for a long time, but it was exhausting and overwhelming. Just felt like there was too much to do and not enough time/understanding to finish.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
take solid breaks. drink lots of water. see my family. get outside at somepoint LOL
Also learned that I can do (and learn) hard things! I feel empowered that things have relatively *"clicked"* so to speak. But still feeling nervous that I don't have the vocabulary to speak in the technical terms yet.
